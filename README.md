# UNP_PROJECT_colab-GROUP_4_-Regression_project-

Completed this project as part of my Data Science and Machine Learning Course with the United Network of Professionals (UNP). Key highlights:

Studied and Analyzed the GARMENT WORKER PERFORMANCE PREDICTION dataset to apply Machine Learning Models and present my insights.

Performed various Exploratory Data Analyses to understand the data and compare the variables.

Experimented with different Machine Learning Algorithms, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest Regression, K - Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, XG

Boost.

Compare the results to recommend the best Regression Model.
